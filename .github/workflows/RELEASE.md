# Installation Instructions

1. Download and install [bpsr-logs___VERSION___x64_en-US.msi](https://github.com/winjwinj/bpsr-logs/releases/download/app-v__VERSION__/bpsr-logs___VERSION___x64_en-US.msi)

# Known Issues
- WinDivert flagged by antivirus as bitcoin mining (the irony here is that people are using spyware, closed source antivirus)
  - See: [Does it mine Bitcoin?](https://github.com/winjwinj/bpsr-logs/?tab=readme-ov-file#does-it-mine-bitcoin)
- ExitLag doesn't work properly 
  - Other VPNs not working is normal (no way around it)
  - Update: Mullvad VPN is working apparently
- Shortcuts
- Can't run with LOA Logs

# Instructions
- Most of what you need is in the Taskbar's System Tray notification icon (e.g. when you enable "Clickthrough", you can disable it here by right-clicking the icon)
    - When you "exit" the app, it hides it in there, doesn't close it
- Left click on player to see skill breakdown (right click to exit back to party)
- Left click on player name to copy #UID for easier searching
- The app auto-updates on launch (I plan to make a UI soonTM)
- The way the game detects players' information is when they "appear/disappear" from your view
