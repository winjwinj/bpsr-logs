BPSR Logs is a "blazingly fast" open source Blue Protocol: Star Resonance DPS meter, written in Rust by [winj](https://github.com/winjwinj). It is heavily inspired by [loa-logs](https://github.com/snoww/loa-logs), and uses reverse engineering work done by [StarResonanceDamageCounter](https://github.com/dmlgzs/StarResonanceDamageCounter) and [@Yuerino](https://github.com/Yuerino).

# Does it mine Bitcoin?
No, it doesnâ€™t mine Bitcoin. If it did, I'd be answering this from my private island.

### Q: Missing `WinDivert64.sys`

A: You need to reinstall meter. The meter uses the WinDivert driver to listen to game packets. You either removed the file or your antivirus removed it. Please create an exception for the entire meter folder, and then reinstall the meter. After reinstalling, you should restart your computer before launching meter.

### Q: Meter isn't detecting anything...

A: There can be multiple reasons. If you have NordVPN installed, meter will not work due to both apps using WinDivert. You need to uninstall Nord, or completely quit the Nord processes and reboot.

### Q: How do I also use ExitLag (and other ping reducers)?

A: ExitLag recently updated their settings which changed how they redirect packets. Change your ExitLag settings to _Packet redirection method > Legacy - NDIS_.

### Q: Meter window is missing / meter window is tiny

A: TBD: Right-click the taskbar icon (located in the bottom right of your screen, next to the system time), click reset position, or load saved position. Adjust the size of the window and location, and then save the position.

### Q: The installer crashes or takes forever to install

A: Are you trying to install on a custom install folder with different permissions? You might need to run the installer in administrator mode due to permission issues.

### Q: The meter crashes immediately when trying to open it. EdgeWebview2 Error.

A: The meter needs Microsoft Edge Webview2 Runtime to run. Yours is probably missing or out of date. Go uninstall it first (it won't let you install it if you have an older version installed), then download and install from [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2124703) (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2124703).

### Q: The meter window lags a lot when dragging around

A: Are you on Windows 11? Disable blur in the settings (settings > accessibility). If you wish to have a dark background with blur disabled, also disable the transparency setting to have a pseudo dark mode.

### Q: Why is some of my information missing when others have it?

A: You opened the meter too late, and it wasn't able to get your character information. It is doing its best by guessing. You can fix this by: switching lines, moving to a different area, relogging, etc.

### Q: There are too many/too few columns in the meter.

A: TBD: You can change whatever column you want to show in the settings. TIP: you can `SHIFT+SCROLL` to scroll horizontally.

### Q: Help, my issue isn't listed here. Or you've tried all these solutions, and it still doesn't work.

A: Search the message history in the [#i-need-help](https://discord.com/channels/1417447600608510015/1427022345482014900) channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Tcc54ST5BU). If you can't find a solution there, please describe your issue.

### Q: Is it really "blazingly fast"?

A: [Yes.](https://i.imgur.com/QsLAntt.png)
